# Short Description
PaLMS is a comprehensive ERP project intended to cover various needs of higher education institutes as an Odoo module. The initial goal of PaLMS is to provide an efficient and secure platform for students, professors, academic supervisors and program managers to handle course work and final qualification work projects. Instead of using Excel tables for project publication or Telegram for communication, every party involved can handle any task related to the process on PaLMS platform itself. In the future, PaLMS is expected to be a highly customizable and versatile product that addresses other needs of higher education institutions as well.
