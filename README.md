PaLMS is a comprehensive ERP project intended to cover various needs of higher education institutes as an Odoo module. The initial goal of the project is to provide an efficient and secure platform for students, professors, academic supervisors and program managers to handle course work and final qualification work submissions and workflows. Instead of using Excel tables for project publication or Telegram for communication, every party involved can handle any task related to the process on PaLMS platform itself. In the future, PaLMS is expected to be a highly customizable and versatile product that addresses other needs of higher education institutions as well.

In the current status of the project, there are 15 models in total which are `application`, `availability`, `campus`, `commission`, `defense`, `degree`, `faculty`, `grade`, `manager`, `professor, program`, `project`, `proposal`, `student` and `supervisor`. These models are encapsulated in a single module called “Student” _(technical representation among resource files is “student”, like “hr” for the “Discuss” module)_. Their purposes can be briefly explained as follows:
- **Application:** Handles project applications from students. Students can submit application to an eligible program if they are not already assigned to a program. If the application is not accepted or rejected by the professor, it is possible for students to cancel it. Professor can accept or reject an application they receive. Accepting an application means that the project will be assigned to this particular student and all the other applications will be rejected in favor of the elected one.
- **Availability:** Defines which level of students in which program can apply for the project. For example, a project could be defined so that it can be applied for as a ВКР (graduation qualification work) for final year students of the Master's in Data Science program.
- **Campus:** This model was added in anticipation that the project will be used in the future for multiple campuses of multiple universities. It does not hold a critical role in the current state of the project, and only includes which university the faculty belongs to and its location.
- **Committee:** Once a project is completed by the student under the guidance of the relevant professor, it has to go through a committee review in order to be graded and formally evaluated. These committees are formed by users in the role of manager in PALMS, as in practice, and they examine the project defenses in presentation format at the set date and time.
- **Defense:** It includes the date of the presentation and by whom the project will be presented. By adding such objects to the committees, managers gather and list the projects that the committees will evaluate.
- **Degree:** Represents the academic progress and level of education of the student (e.g. first-year Master’s degree). This model aids in determining the eligibility of students when they intend to apply to a published project.
- **Faculty:** Represents the highest level of academic hierarchy, encompassing professors, programs and more, providing a comprehensive structure for the higher education institute.
- **Grade:** Allows commission members to grade projects with confidentiality.
- **Manager:** Encapsulates the _res.users_ module that Odoo provides to regulate system users for the purpose of specifying program managers in PALMS. It is used to indicate that the user who logs into the system is a manager and has rights such as forming committees and browsing project results. 
- **Professor:** Defines a faculty professor, enriching the existing _res.users_ module as in the case of managers. Users of this type can accept proposals, submit projects, review student applications.
- **Program:** It describes the direction in which students study within faculties. It comprises of students and projects. Academic supervisors have control over this structure and their authority is limited to their own programs.
- **Project:** Projects stand out as the cornerstone of the PALMS business process and are by far the largest model of the system. Projects are created by professors, regulated by supervisors and completed by students. When projects are assigned to a student, a project.project model object with the same name is created in the Odoo system to facilitate task tracking and made accessible to the student and the professor.
The PALMS _student.project_ model, which addresses an academic purpose, should not be confused with _project.project_, Odoo's multipurpose task management module.
- **Proposal:** They are designed to enable students to submit their academic project ideas in a systematic way for professors' evaluation. Proposals are created by students and evaluated by professors. Approved proposals become projects.
- **Student:** Represents corresponding _res.users_ objects (of student user group) that send applications and be assigned to a project, for supervisor’s ease. 
- **Supervisor:** A collection of utility functions, views, and module functionalities shared across models, allowing easy code maintenance.

## PALMS Console

In order to turn PALMS into a sustainable solution and to enable it to adapt to changing conditions, it is necessary to provide an interface, especially for system administrators, where the features and settings of the application can be changed. This interface should be specifically designed to be able to tweak the functionality of PALMS and, if necessary, even change the existing business process. In order to add these features to the project and to create a low-code environment, a Flask web application has been developed that can directly interfere with the code of both the back-end and the front-end of the PALMS module.

The Flask application, named “PALMS Console”, serves as an interactive interface for visualizing and manipulating Odoo view files (.xml) and module files (.py). The application is designed to parse the structure of Odoo views and modules, display the content in a user-friendly format, and allow users to make changes that are reflected back to the original files.
